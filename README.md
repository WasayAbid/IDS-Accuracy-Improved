# Machine Learning Final Project: Enhanced Classification on KDD Cup 1999 Dataset

## Project Overview

This project, for a Machine Learning course, aimed to improve classification accuracy on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset (using `kdd_train` for training and `kdd_test` for testing), previously used in research that achieved 67% accuracy. We employed hyperparameter tuning to significantly enhance model performance.

## Dataset

We used the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, specifically `kdd_train` and `kdd_test`. [Optional: *Very brief* description - e.g., "Network intrusion detection dataset, with 41 features."] Original research:

## Methodology

We optimized a [model type, e.g., "Random Forest"] model using various hyperparameter tuning techniques:

1.  **[Hyperparameter Tuning Technique 1]:** [Brief description - e.g., "Grid Search for comprehensive parameter space exploration."]
2.  **[Hyperparameter Tuning Technique 2]:** [Brief description - e.g., "Randomized Search for efficient exploration of wider ranges."]
3.  [**Other Key Steps (Concise):**  E.g., "Data preprocessing: scaling, encoding. Feature selection: [method]."]

## Results

| Metric    | Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Accuracy  | 0.999456          | 0.912615       |

We achieved 91.26% test accuracy, significantly exceeding the original 67%. High training accuracy (99.95%) suggests some overfitting, but generalization remains strong.

## Conclusion

Hyperparameter tuning substantially improved classification accuracy on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, surpassing the original research. This demonstrates the importance of model optimization.

## Future Work (Optional)

*   Explore other models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Deep Learning).
*   Try advanced optimization (e.g., Bayesian Optimization).
*   Gather more data (if relevant/possible for this dataset).

## How to Run (Optional - Very Concise)

1.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable)
2.  Place `kdd_train` and `kdd_test` in `data` directory (or adjust paths accordingly).
3.  Run: `python [your_script_name].py`
